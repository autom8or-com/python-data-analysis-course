# Week 1 Assignments - Introduction and Environment Setup

This folder contains the assignments for Week 1 of the Python for Data Analysis course.

## Assignment Structure

There are two types of assignments:

3. Complete all tasks in the notebook, making sure to run all cells
4. Submit your completed notebook according to the submission instructions

### Best Practices:

- Read all instructions carefully before starting
- Make sure your code is well-commented and organized
- Run all cells to verify your solutions work correctly
- Double-check your work against the grading criteria

## Submission Instructions
