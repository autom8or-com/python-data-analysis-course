Students will master statistical testing frameworks, comparative analysis techniques, and advanced regression modeling using real Olist e-commerce data with live Supabase database integration.

## Learning Objectives
- Master statistical hypothesis testing and business interpretation
- Apply comparative analysis techniques (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA)
- Build and validate linear regression models for business prediction
- Implement A/B testing frameworks for model deployment
- Design production-ready model monitoring and evaluation systems
- Translate statistical results into actionable business recommendations
