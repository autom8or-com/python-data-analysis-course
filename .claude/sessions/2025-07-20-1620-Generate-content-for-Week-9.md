**Incomplete Tasks**: None

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Complete Week 9 Curriculum**: Created comprehensive 6-part lecture series covering Streamlit from fundamentals to production deployment
2. **Enterprise-Grade Content**: Developed production-ready educational materials with real business applications
3. **Database Integration**: Successfully integrated Supabase MCP throughout all materials as requested
4. **Assignment Development**: Created both individual (minor) and group (major) assignments with detailed rubrics
5. **Course Continuity**: Maintained consistency with established course patterns and file naming conventions

### Features Implemented
- **6 Lecture Notebooks**: Progressive curriculum from basics to advanced deployment
- **4 Standalone Apps**: Demo applications for hands-on learning
- **2 Assignment Notebooks**: Comprehensive assessment materials with business focus
- **Supabase MCP Integration**: Live database connectivity throughout curriculum
- **Business Intelligence Focus**: Real-world applications using Olist e-commerce data
- **Google Colab Compatibility**: All materials optimized for course platform

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Module Import Error**: 
   - **Problem**: Utilities module not available in Colab environment
   - **Solution**: Replaced custom imports with standard matplotlib/seaborn styling
   - **Location**: `01_streamlit_fundamentals_part1_setup_architecture.ipynb:cell-4`

2. **Database Technology Clarification**:
   - **Problem**: Initial mention of "neon mcp" was corrected to "supabase mcp"
   - **Solution**: Updated all content to use Supabase MCP integration patterns
   - **Impact**: Consistent database integration across all materials

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `.claude/sessions/.current-session` to track active session
- Created new session documentation file with comprehensive tracking
- All notebooks configured for Google Colab environment

### Dependencies
**Added**: No new package dependencies (leveraged existing course stack)  
**Required for Students**:
- `streamlit` - Core framework
- `pyngrok` - Colab tunneling for external access
- `plotly` - Interactive visualizations
- Standard data science stack (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Breaking Changes
**None** - All content follows established course patterns and maintains backward compatibility

### Important Findings
1. **Course Architecture Alignment**: Week 9 successfully bridges Month 2 (analysis) with Month 4 (capstone)
2. **Supabase Integration**: MCP server provides seamless database connectivity for live applications
3. **Streamlit Pedagogy**: Script-to-app model aligns well with data science workflow
4. **Assessment Balance**: Minor/major assignment structure maintains course grading consistency

### What Wasn't Completed
**Nothing** - All planned Week 9 content was successfully completed to specification

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Environment Setup**: Always provide fallback styling for Colab environments where custom modules may not be available
2. **Database Integration**: Supabase MCP requires proper authentication setup in production
3. **Streamlit Performance**: Emphasize `@st.cache_data` for expensive operations, especially database queries
4. **Business Context**: Maintain focus on real-world applications using Olist dataset throughout
5. **Assignment Grading**: Use detailed rubrics with both technical and business analysis components
6. **Deployment**: Consider Streamlit Cloud limitations and provide alternative deployment strategies

### Content Quality Standards Met
✓ Google Colab compatibility  
✓ Business intelligence focus  
✓ Progressive difficulty curve  
✓ Real-world data integration  
✓ Professional assessment structure  
✓ Enterprise deployment readiness  
✓ Course architecture alignment  

**Session Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for student delivery

## Notes
- Week 9 is part of Month 3 (Streamlit development and project preparation)
- Focus on Streamlit fundamentals, interactive dashboards, and deployment preparation
- Content should bridge from data analysis (Months 1-2) to capstone project (Month 4)
- All notebooks must be Google Colab compatible
- Integration with Olist dataset for business context
