    "## Major Group Assignment: Pandas Fundamentals I\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Thursday, April 24, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work in groups of 3-4 students to explore and analyze an e-commerce dataset using Pandas. This assignment will allow you to apply the fundamental pandas concepts covered in Week 2, particularly focusing on DataFrame creation, column selection, row filtering, and translating SQL queries to pandas code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Load and inspect data using pandas\n",
    "- Select and filter data using pandas methods\n",
    "- Create derived columns and manipulate DataFrame structure\n",
    "- Translate SQL queries into equivalent pandas operations\n",
    "- Perform basic data analysis using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "You will be working with an e-commerce sales dataset containing information about orders, products, customers, and transactions. The dataset is available in the `Data` folder as `ecommerce_sales.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Structure\n",
    "This assignment is divided into five parts:\n",
    "1. Data Loading and Inspection\n",
    "2. Basic DataFrame Operations\n",
    "3. Selection and Filtering\n",
    "4. SQL to Pandas Translation\n",
    "5. Data Analysis Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook via the course portal\n",
    "- Include the names of all team members in the notebook\n",
    "- Ensure all code cells are executed and outputs are visible\n",
    "- Add comments to explain your code and reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria\n",
    "- Correctness of code: 60%\n",
    "- Code efficiency and best practices: 20%\n",
    "- Analysis and interpretation: 15%\n",
    "- Code documentation: 5%\n",
