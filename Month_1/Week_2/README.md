## Session Details

### NumPy Fundamentals (Wednesday)
NumPy is the foundation for numerical computing in Python. In this session, we'll explore:

#### Key Topics
- Advantages of NumPy over Python lists
- Creating and manipulating arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Broadcasting and vectorization
- Performance optimization

#### Schedule
- **Hour 1 (10:00-11:00)**: Lecture and demonstrations
- **Hour 2 (11:00-12:00)**: Guided practice and individual work

### Pandas Fundamentals I (Thursday)
Pandas is built on NumPy and provides powerful data structures for data manipulation. This session covers:

#### Key Topics
- Series and DataFrame objects
- Creating and inspecting DataFrames
- Selecting columns and filtering rows
- Translating SQL queries to Pandas code
- Reading and writing data files

#### Schedule
- **Hour 1 (10:00-11:00)**: Lecture and demonstrations 
- **Hour 2 (11:00-12:00)**: Collaborative group exercises

## Assignments

### Minor Assignment (Due: April 22, 2025)
**NumPy Array Manipulation**: Individual assignment to practice creating, manipulating, and analyzing NumPy arrays.

### Major Group Assignment (Due: April 24, 2025)
**Dataset Exploration with Pandas**: Group assignment to import, explore, and analyze a provided e-commerce dataset using Pandas.

## Tips for Success
- Practice executing the code examples in the lecture notebooks
- Experiment with different parameters and methods
- Complete all practice exercises before attempting the assignments
- Connect the concepts to your SQL knowledge
- Collaborate with classmates on challenging topics

## Next Week Preview
Week 3 will dive deeper into Pandas for data manipulation, covering more advanced operations:
- Advanced data cleaning and filtering
- GroupBy operations (similar to SQL GROUP BY)
- Aggregation functions
- Pivot tables and cross-tabulations
