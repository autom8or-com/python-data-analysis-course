# Week 2: Practice Exercises

This folder contains practice exercises for Week 2: Python Libraries for Data Analysis, with a focus on Pandas Fundamentals.

## Overview

The practice exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the Week 2 lectures. They are split into three separate notebooks to make them more manageable:

1. **pandas_fundamentals_practice_part1.ipynb**: Creating and exploring DataFrames
2. **pandas_fundamentals_practice_part2.ipynb**: Column selection and basic operations
3. **pandas_fundamentals_practice_part3.ipynb**: Row selection, filtering, and SQL to Pandas translation

## How to Use These Exercises

1. Start with Part 1 and work through the exercises in order
2. Read each exercise carefully and try to solve it on your own
3. Write your code in the provided cells
4. Run your code to check your solution
5. Compare your approach with the provided solution
6. If you're stuck, review the lecture materials or ask for help

## Topics Covered

### Part 1: Creating and Exploring DataFrames
- Creating DataFrames from dictionaries
- Loading data from CSV files
- Creating DataFrames from NumPy arrays
- Exploring DataFrame properties (shape, columns, data types, etc.)

### Part 2: Column Selection and Basic Operations
- Selecting columns using different methods
- Creating new columns
- Handling missing values
- Basic data manipulation

### Part 3: Row Selection, Filtering, and SQL to Pandas Translation
- Basic row filtering
- Advanced filtering with multiple conditions
- Using `loc` and `iloc` for selection
- Translating SQL queries to Pandas code

## Prerequisite Knowledge

These exercises assume familiarity with:
- Basic Python syntax
- NumPy fundamentals (covered in Week 2, Day 1)
- SQL (prerequisite for the course)
