# Pandas Fundamentals II - Part 1: Indexing and Selection

## Week 3, Day 1 (Wednesday) - April 23rd, 2025

### Overview
This is the first part of our second session on Pandas fundamentals, focusing on indexing and selection techniques. Understanding how to efficiently select, access, and extract specific data from DataFrames is essential for effective data analysis.

### Learning Objectives
- Master different ways to select data from Pandas DataFrames
- Understand the difference between label-based and position-based indexing
- Learn how to select data using single and multiple criteria
- Apply SQL-like thinking to Pandas data selection

### Prerequisites
- Python fundamentals (Week 1)
- NumPy basics (Week 2, Day 1)
- Pandas Fundamentals I (Week 2, Day 2)
- SQL knowledge (prior to course)

## 1. Introduction to Indexing and Selection

Selecting and accessing specific data from a DataFrame is one of the most common operations in data analysis. Pandas provides multiple ways to do this, often more flexible than SQL's `SELECT` statements.

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'product_id': ['P001', 'P002', 'P003', 'P004', 'P005'],
    'product_name': ['Laptop', 'Smartphone', 'Tablet', 'Headphones', 'Monitor'],
    'category': ['Electronics', 'Electronics', 'Electronics', 'Accessories', 'Electronics'],
    'price': [1200, 800, 450, 150, 300],
    'in_stock': [True, True, False, True, True]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Sample DataFrame:")
print(df)
```

## 2. Basic Column Selection

### Selecting a Single Column

In SQL, you use: `SELECT column_name FROM table`. In Pandas, there are multiple ways to select columns:

```python
# Method 1: Using dictionary-like notation (returns a Series)
product_names = df['product_name']
print("\nProduct names (Series):")
print(product_names)

# Method 2: Using attribute notation (dot notation)
# Only works if column name has no spaces/special chars and doesn't overlap with DataFrame methods
categories = df.category
print("\nCategories (Series):")
print(categories)
```

### Selecting Multiple Columns

In SQL: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM table`. In Pandas:

```python
# Select multiple columns (returns a DataFrame)
product_info = df[['product_name', 'price']]
print("\nProduct info (multiple columns):")
print(product_info)
```

## 3. Position-Based Indexing with iloc

`iloc` is used for integer-location based indexing (like array indexing in NumPy).

### Basic Row Selection

```python
# Select a single row by position
first_row = df.iloc[0]
print("\nFirst row:")
print(first_row)

# Select multiple rows
first_three_rows = df.iloc[0:3]
print("\nFirst three rows:")
print(first_three_rows)
```

### Row and Column Selection

```python
# Select specific rows and columns by position
# Format: df.iloc[row_selection, column_selection]

# Select first 2 rows and columns 1,2 (0-indexed)
subset = df.iloc[0:2, 1:3]
print("\nSubset with iloc (first 2 rows, columns 1-2):")
print(subset)

# Select specific rows and columns with lists
specific_cells = df.iloc[[0, 2, 4], [1, 3]]  # Rows 0,2,4 and columns 1,3
print("\nSpecific cells with iloc:")
print(specific_cells)
```

## 4. Label-Based Indexing with loc

`loc` is used for label-based indexing, working with row and column labels instead of positions.

### Basic Row Selection with loc

```python
# First, let's set the product_id as the index to demonstrate label-based indexing
df_indexed = df.set_index('product_id')
print("\nDataFrame with product_id as index:")
print(df_indexed)

# Select a single row by label
product_p002 = df_indexed.loc['P002']
print("\nProduct P002:")
print(product_p002)

# Select multiple rows by label
selected_products = df_indexed.loc[['P001', 'P003', 'P005']]
print("\nSelected products:")
print(selected_products)
```

### Row and Column Selection with loc

```python
# Select specific rows and columns by label
# Format: df.loc[row_selection, column_selection]

# Select specific products and columns
product_details = df_indexed.loc[['P001', 'P004'], ['product_name', 'price']]
print("\nProduct details with loc:")
print(product_details)

# Slicing with loc (inclusive of end point)
slice_products = df_indexed.loc['P001':'P003', 'product_name':'in_stock']
print("\nSliced products with loc (inclusive):")
print(slice_products)
```

## 5. Using Boolean Indexing for Filtering

One of the most powerful features of Pandas is boolean indexing - similar to SQL's WHERE clause.

```python
# Back to our original DataFrame
print("\nOriginal DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Filter products with price > 500
expensive_products = df[df['price'] > 500]
print("\nExpensive products (price > 500):")
print(expensive_products)

# Multiple conditions (using & for AND, | for OR)
# In SQL: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price < 500
affordable_electronics = df[(df['category'] == 'Electronics') & (df['price'] < 500)]
print("\nAffordable electronics:")
print(affordable_electronics)

# Complex filters
# In SQL: SELECT * FROM products WHERE (category = 'Electronics' AND price > 300) OR in_stock = False
complex_filter = df[((df['category'] == 'Electronics') & (df['price'] > 300)) | (df['in_stock'] == False)]
print("\nComplex filter results:")
print(complex_filter)
```

## 6. Combining Different Selection Methods

You can combine these methods for more complex selections:

```python
# Use boolean indexing first, then select specific columns
# In SQL: SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics'
electronics_names_prices = df[df['category'] == 'Electronics'][['product_name', 'price']]
print("\nElectronics names and prices:")
print(electronics_names_prices)

# Alternative using loc
electronics_names_prices_alt = df.loc[df['category'] == 'Electronics', ['product_name', 'price']]
print("\nElectronics names and prices (using loc):")
print(electronics_names_prices_alt)
```

## 7. Selecting Specific Data Types

Sometimes you want to select columns based on their data types:

```python
# Select numeric columns
numeric_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64'])
print("\nNumeric columns:")
print(numeric_cols)

# Select object (string) columns
string_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object'])
print("\nString columns:")
print(string_cols)

# Select boolean columns
bool_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['bool'])
print("\nBoolean columns:")
print(bool_cols)
```

## 8. The .at and .iat Accessors for Single Value Selection

For fast scalar lookup:

```python
# .at for label-based scalar lookups
# Get the price of product P003 (assuming product_id is the index)
p003_price = df_indexed.at['P003', 'price']
print(f"\nPrice of P003: {p003_price}")

# .iat for integer-based scalar lookups
# Get the value in the first row, third column
first_row_third_col = df.iat[0, 2]
print(f"\nValue at first row, third column: {first_row_third_col}")
```

## 9. SQL Translation Guide

Here's a quick reference for translating SQL SELECT operations to Pandas:

| SQL Operation | Pandas Equivalent |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `SELECT * FROM table` | `df` |
| `SELECT col FROM table` | `df['col']` or `df.col` |
| `SELECT col1, col2 FROM table` | `df[['col1', 'col2']]` |
| `SELECT * FROM table WHERE col = value` | `df[df['col'] == value]` |
| `SELECT * FROM table WHERE col1 = val1 AND col2 = val2` | `df[(df['col1'] == val1) & (df['col2'] == val2)]` |
| `SELECT * FROM table WHERE col IN (val1, val2)` | `df[df['col'].isin([val1, val2])]` |
| `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5` | `df.head(5)` |
| `SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY col` | `df.sort_values('col')` |

## 10. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Selection
Using the sample DataFrame, select all products that are in stock.

### Exercise 2: Label-Based Selection
Using the indexed version of the DataFrame, select the product name and category for products P002 and P005.

### Exercise 3: SQL to Pandas Translation
Translate the following SQL query to Pandas:
```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' 
AND price BETWEEN 300 AND 1000
ORDER BY price DESC
```

### Exercise 4: Complex Selection
Select all electronics products with prices above the average price of all products.
