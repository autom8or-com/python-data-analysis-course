    "## Major Group Assignment: Advanced Pandas Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Thursday, April 24, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this assignment, your group will apply advanced Pandas operations covered in today's lecture: GroupBy operations, aggregation functions, and pivot tables/cross-tabulations. You'll use these techniques to analyze the customer purchase dataset and derive meaningful business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Apply GroupBy operations to segment and analyze data\n",
    "- Use various aggregation functions to summarize data\n",
    "- Create and interpret pivot tables and cross-tabulations\n",
    "- Translate SQL GROUP BY queries to equivalent Pandas operations\n",
    "- Visualize aggregated data for better interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "You will continue working with the customer purchase dataset (`customer_purchase_data.csv`) that you used in the previous assignment, which contains information about customers, their demographics, and their purchase transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Structure\n",
    "This assignment is divided into five parts:\n",
    "1. Data Preparation\n",
    "2. GroupBy Operations\n",
    "3. Aggregation Functions\n",
    "4. Pivot Tables and Cross-Tabulations\n",
    "5. Business Analysis and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Guidelines\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook via the course portal\n",
    "- Include the names of all team members in the notebook\n",
    "- Ensure all code cells are executed and outputs are visible\n",
    "- Add comments to explain your code and reasoning\n",
    "- One submission per group is sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria\n",
    "- Correctness of code: 50%\n",
    "- Quality of analysis and insights: 30%\n",
    "- Visualizations and presentation: 15%\n",
    "- Code documentation: 5%\n",
